# AI-Vengers

This GitHub repository holds training and validation code for Deep Learning and Machine Learning models to detect racial demographics of patients through the use of medical images.

The **data** and **models** folders will be empty as -
1. The data and model file occupy a large amount of data and cannot be pushed onto GitHub repositories.
2. Some of the data used to conduct experiments is proprietary. URLs were attached for the open-source datasets. 
3. The trained ML/DL models can be used to re-create the patient information unto certain levels which could leak the proprietary data.
